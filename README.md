### PROJECT SETUP   

#### 0. General Warnings   

You are decided to build your lightsaber. Cool !   
Don't think I want to deceive you from your goal but you 'll have to keep those things in mind :    
    
* ___This project is not plug and play !___ It's tough, time consuming and you'll spend some times in trial and errors. But it's also highly rewarding once completed with success.     
* ___This project might be cheap___, but it's highly unlikely. If you don't make mistake it can be. If you do you'll have to go on spare parts,etc... and costs can grew up.     
* ___Think twice about your power supply/LED relations ! This is CRUCIAL!___ A power supply that gives to much voltage for your LEDs will result in burned LEDs. We don't recommend the use of power supply that exceed total LED's voltage capacity. While it's still possible, if you do go down this path, calculate, think, ask questions and USE A MULTIMETER ! 
Beware of MAX_BRIGHTNESS setting. While this can remove some voltage from your LEDs it's certainly can not remove too much. Each MOSFETs can take a certain amount of voltage but it will heat up. And too much it can ruin your MOSFET or your DIYNO board.     
This choice is ___THE MOST IMPORTANT CHOICE___ for your device !!!!    
Also mind the intensity (Amps) your setup will require...     
I told you it will be tough !  
* ___You will have shorts !!!___ Well I hope you don't, in fact. Keep in mind that solders on your board are not bullet proof, even for experienced people. The more your board will move, the more these solderings will be exposed to breakage and that will lead to short cuts. On a fully completed blade, this mostly results in unresponsivness : the blade will stops flickering, you won't hear anymore swings and you won't be able to retract the blade until you cut the power off (remove battery, or plug a kill key).
Isolate your buttons leads too, contact with metal hull => short cut. You'll want thermoretractable sheath and maybe hot glue.  
* ___Consider a kill key !___ They'll preserve your batteries from draining out when you're not using your saber, allows you to recharge your saber, allows you to quickly shut down your saber.... You want to put a kill key !     

#### 1. IMU calibration 
 First, you'll need (if not already done) to calibrate your MPU6050. DIYino boards come pre-calibrated with calibration values stored starting from EEPROM address 96 or 200 (see comments for branch LSOS 1.5) 
 [I recommend you use the AutoCalibration script you can find here](https://github.com/Protonerd/DIYino/blob/master/MPU6050_calibration.ino)  


#### 2. Determine IMU orientation
 The way you physically installed the MPU6050 in your hilt will influence how swing detection works.  
 You'll have to determine which IMU's axis is parallel to blade axis and change it accordingly in __Config.h__ :   
```c++
//#define BLADE_X
#define BLADE_Y
//#define BLADE_Z
```


#### 3. Prepare your SDCard
Then, put the content of _SDCard.7z_ on your SDCard:  

1. Format your SDCard. __I insist !__  (go read __HOW TO MANAGE YOUR SDRCARD__ section for further explanation)
2. Unzip SDCard.7z to a folder
3. Select all the files from this folder and __"Drag and Drop"__ them to your SDCard. __NO COPY AND PASTE !!!__ :
We need to have this file copied in the same order as their filename order. On Microsoft Windows, Copy/paste produce an anarchic copy order, but Drag and Drop produce an ordered copy as long as you select the first file to init the drag...  


#### 4. Check Wirings
_If you use DIYino board, don't mind that paragraph._[Go there instead and read user manual](https://github.com/Protonerd/DIYino/blob/master/DIYino_Prime_v1_User_Manual.pdf)     
_If you use DIYino board v1, and want flicker effect wire SPK+ to A6 and SPK- to A7. Starting with v1.5 and Stardust this connections is included on-board._

Using  **Protonerd's** wirings.    
Don't forget to wire those ones which were added :  
* DFPLAYER TX to D7
* DFPLAYER SPK+ to A6
* DFPLAYER SPK- to A7  

#### 5. Select your blade type


###### A.LEDSTRINGS 
In __Config.h__  be sure this line is uncommented :
```c++
#define LEDSTRINGS 
```   

###### B. RGB LEDs or Single LED
In __Config.h__  comment this line :
```c++
#define STAR_LED 
``` 

###### C. Neopixel stripes
	
* b) In __Config.h__  comment this line :
	
```c++ 
#define PIXELBLADE 
```

#### 6. Compile and Upload the sketch to your Arduino device

#### 7. Enjoy

### HOW TO MANAGE YOUR SDCRAD
#### 1. For DFPlayer Mini

While there are several ways to make the DIYino board play your sound files from your SDard, only one can provide full gapless sound "enqueuing" : we need to call each sound file by their copy order number.    

Let's say you have a fresh formatted SDcard.   
You copy one file on it : its copy order is 1.   
You copy another one: its copy order is 2. 
You copy another one: its copy order is 3.   

Now the main "problem" to be aware of is : you remove file 2 (because you maybe want to replace it) : file 3 keep is order number.
You copy another one: its copy order is 4.    

In that case the only proper way to manage your SDCard I found is he following :    
1. You create a folder called _sdcard_ on your computer    
2. Using a batch renamer utility (I personnaly use [Bulk Rename Utility](http://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/Main_Intro.php)) you rename and copy your sound files to that folder in the order you planned     
3. You format your SDCard   
4. You select all your files from _sdcard_ directory and __DRAG AND DROP__ them to your SDCard.   

Drag and drop on windows genereate a ordered copy following file name sorting.    
Copy and paste (Crtl+C/Ctrl+V) generate an anarchic ordered copy. Don't use it !  

Each time you will want to modify one file you'll have to do it that way. Adding files on he other hand can be done without formatting.   

Files MUST be named that way :   
_XXXX[-myfileName].wav_   
where :   
* XXXX is the order number planned (ex.: 0001, 0002, 2568,...)    
* [-myfileName] is OPTIONNAL. But I encourage you to put one to ease up organisation.    
__YOU MUST ABSOLUTLY AVOID ALL GAPS IN THE ORDER NUMBER YOU PLANNED !!!__    

You can put files in different folders if you like. You don't necessarily need to let them on SDCard root.     
__BUT STILL BEWARE OF THOSE NUMBERS !!!!__   
Here are different examples of organisation you can use :

* All in SDCard root (like SDCard.7z example provided)   
* 1 folder for each SoundFonts. For example :    
	* **_CONFIG_** folder containing files numbered 0001 to 0020
	* **_Barlow's_** folder containing files numbered 0021 to 0053
	* **_MySoundfont_** folder containing files numbered 0079 to 0124
	* **_ZZZZZ_** folder containing files numbered 0054 to 0078
In this example files in ZZZZZ have been copied BEFORE those in MySoundfont
* an other example of organisation :
	* **_CONFIG_** folder containing files numbered 0001 to 0020
	* **_Barlow's_** folder containing files  0021-PowerOn.wav, 0022-PowerOff.wav,0023-Hum.wav,0024-Boot.wav
	* **_Swing_** folder containing only swing sound files numbered 0025 to 1075
	* **_Clash_** folder containing only clash sound files numbered 1076 to 1078
	* **_Blaster_** folder containing only blaster sound files numbered 1079 to 2001
	* **_Lockup_** folder containing only lockup sound files numbered 2002 to 2024   
	* **_MySoundFont_** folder containing files numbered 2025-Hum.wav, 2026-Boot.wav 2027-PowerOff.wav,2028-PowerOn.wav      
In that case, the user wants to be able to use all of his swing/clash/blaster/lockup/etc. sounds with every of its soundfont.   
He can also configure some soundfont to use just a part like for example Swings 0100 to 0153.

### HOW TO PERSONNALIZE CONFIG MENU SOUNDS

Let's say you want to change the lady voice or ladies users may want their saber with a male voice or you may want her to talk in Dutch or French or Italian or Spanish (name your langage here).    


I used [this online free Text-To-Speech generator](http://www.fromtexttospeech.com/) to produce those sounds.   
You can produce your own sentences with it or use any other Text-To-Speech program.  
For example :    
"Hello Master! You just entered into Config Mode !"    
Then rename the file it produces : 0001-CONFIG-ConfigMode.mp3. Remove old 0001-CONFIG-ConfigMode.wav file.    


**_N.B.:_**       
1. _Only in Config Mode case_, mp3 are OK to use. We don't care in this mode if there's sound gap.   
2. Every changes in sounds file will force you to format your SDCard and copy the whole lot again.
________________________________________________________________________________ 

### HOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN SOUNDFONT

[In this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_6VITJT0-w), you'll learn how to create the differents lightsabers sounds-effects.   

You can experiment with different device to produce some unique sounds.   

Then use Audacity to mix them.    

Final sounds **MUST BE** in WAV format (**_NO MP3 ! NO WMA!_**)!   
When encoding a sound to those format (MP3 or WMA) the encoder will automaticly put a silence at start.
